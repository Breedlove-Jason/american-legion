HOME SECTION 2

PATRIOTIC DAYS

MEMORIAL DAY has always been an special occasion in this community. In addition to memorial events throughout the Auburn area, the grave of every veteran of any of the wars of the country are decorated with an American flag on this National Holiday. Today, jointly with many volunteers, this tradition is being carried on. Auburn's veteran organizations will carry on this tradition to its last man to keep MEMORIAL DAY sacred to the memory of our war dead.

VETERANS DAY, originally ARMISTICE DAY, marked the end of fighting in World War One. It is an important holiday on the calendar of Legionnaires everywhere and in the hearts of all veterans. It has been in Auburn. Annually the Post sponsored the Armistice Day Parade. An important tradition was established when the Post led in the memorial exercises at 11 o'clock on the morning of November 11, marking the exact hour of the cessation of hostility on the war fronts. Today, together with all Auburn veteran organizations, our Post 84 solemnly observes this tradition.

REGISTRATION OF GRAVES

Our Post 84 is participating in the Auburn area veteran graves registration.  Grave Registration enables all interested parties to locate the site of the grave of each veteran. The New Auburn Cemetary has been marked by the erection of a massive monument marking it as the burial site of many veterans. Each year, together with other veterans organizations, members place a flag on the grave of each veteran for Memorial Day.

AUBURN POST 84 CARES

We actively support veterans needing a hand up.

Every year we send three boys to Boys State, two girls to Girls State, give two scholarships, and we award outstanding students in all the area elementary schools.

SCHOLARSHIP AND COMMUNITY PROJECTS

Auburn Post 84 Sponsors various scholarships for the further education of our children. We also sponsor and financially assist many worthy community projects and programs initiated by the National American Legion.

JOIN US AND KEEP THIS HISTORY ALIVE.

COMMANDER'S CALL

The American Legion was chartered in 1919 by the United States Congress.  It primary function was to serve veterans as well as service members.  It presently is one of the most influential nonprofit groups in America.  Membership has grown rapidly and presently there are over 2.4 million members in 14,000 post worldwide.

Over the years the American Legion has affected social change in America winning many benefits for our deserving veterans.  The official name "The American Legion" was adopted in May 1919.  That same year the first national convention was convened in Minneapolis, MN, at which time Indianapolis, IN, was selected as the national headquarters instead of Washington DC.  In 1921, due to efforts by the Legion, the U.S. Veterans Bureau was created.  It is now known as the Veterans Administration.  In 1923 the American Legion drafted the first "Flag Code" but it was not until 1942 that Congress adopted the Legions Flag Code.  In 1925 the Legion created the American Legion Baseball program with over 80,000 youths playing today.  In June 1935 the first American Legion Boys State was convened in Springfield, IL.

Auburn's Richard W. Townsend Post 84 has its own rich history.  This Post is regularly involved in many civic activities throughout the year.  Participation in those events by Post members varies.  The effectiveness and impact the Post can have on the community is directly related in the personal involvement of each member.  Remember, this Post will only be as effective as our members make it.  Consider coming to one of our monthly meetings (2nd Wednesday of each month) and seeing what is discussed and how your input affects our programs.  Get involved and share your enthusiasm.

BOY'S STATE
Caliofornia State University, Sacramento
American Legion Boys State is among the most respected and selective educational programs of government instruction for high school students. It is a participatory program where each participant becomes a part of the operation of his local, county and state government.

Boys State has been a program of The American Legion since 1935 when it organized to counter the Fascist inspired Young Pioneer Camps. The program was the idea of two Illinois Legionnaires, Hayes Kennedy and Harold Card, who organized the first Boys State at the Illinois State Fairgrounds in Springfield.

At American Legion Boys State, participants are exposed to the rights and privileges, the duties and the responsibilities of a franchised citizen. The training is objective and practical with city, county and state governments operated by the students elected to the various offices. Activities include legislative sessions, court proceedings, law enforcement presentations, assemblies, bands, chorus and recreational programs.

High school juniors are selected by local American Legion Posts to attend the program. In most cases, expenses associated with attending this program are paid by a sponsoring American Legion Post, a local business or another community-based organization.

American Legion Boys State is currently conducted in 49 Departments of The American Legion. Hawaii does not conduct a program. As separate corporations, Boys States vary in content and method of procedure, but each and every Boys State adheres to the basic concept of the program - that of teaching government from the township to the state level.
The American Legion Auxiliary sponsors a similar program for young ladies called Girls State. For online details visit www.legion.org

 MEMORIAL DAY

Memorial Day is a hallowed day to American veterans.


Memorial Day is observed on the last Monday in May. Memorial Day was officially proclaimed and was first observed on 30 May 1868, when flowers were placed on the graves of Union and Confederate soldiers at Arlington National Cemetery. National Moment of Remembrance
Memorial Day represents one day of national awareness and reverence, honoring those Americans who died while defending our Nation and its values.

Americans, pause for one minute on Memorial Day, to remember and reflect on the sacrifices made by so many to provide freedom for all.  Congressional resolution was passed in 2000
From the following verse, the idea was conceived to wear red poppies on Memorial Day in honor of those who died serving the nation during war

In Flanders fields the poppies blow
Between the crosses, row on row,
                         In Flanders Fields by John McCrae, May 1915

The ceremony is described on the Next Page

LEGION RIDERS
The American Legion Riders

        What Are The American Legion Riders?
Simply an enjoyable post activity now a commission of the Department of California for Legionnaires, Auxiliary members, and SAL members thru out the state who enjoy motorcycle riding--and an ideal way to support The American Legion's programs.  Since motorcycle riding is becoming a popular free time and social activity, Posts and Departments can benefit from the growing popularity of The American Legion Riders (ALR) as a way to connect and communicate across the Nation.   As the membership of the ALR is a very diverse group, so are the programs that they are involved in. By allowing each American Legion Rider Chapter to give their members the ability to manage their programs at the Post level, the program has been allowed to grow. Today there exist nearly 100 Legion Rider programs in more than 32 states, and more are organizing each year. The types of things that these groups are doing are far too many to mention in this space, but here are a few examples:

   •     Participation in the annual POW/MIA Rally held each Memorial weekend in Washington D.C. known as "Rolling Thunder" & the National Veterans Awareness Ride to Washington D.C. each year.
   •     Sponsoring or participating in local charity events in support of the sponsoring American Legion Post 84 in Auburn California

   •     Raising money for such organizations as local VA Hospitals, Battered Women and Children's Center, Varied Children and Youth programs, a School for Blind Children, Veterans Relief, Needy families and many, many others
   •     Sponsoring or participating in motorcycle "Runs" to benefit numerous charities, including charities for underprivileged children and medical research, or the September 11 Legacy Scholarship Fund, just to name a few

   •     Participation in countless memorial ceremonies and community parades
   •     One group is even spearheading an effort to erect a "Veterans Memorial Park" in the center of their Downtown area

   •     Legion Riders are also an excellent tool to teach motorcycle and driver safety in the community and in schools.    •     Participating in Patriot Guard Riders (PGR) missions, and Welcome Home for our Service Men and Women.
The recognition and acceptance of ALR groups by local communities has been remarkable. The American Legion Riders in Garden City, Michigan was even honored by the local city council, when they drafted a resolution declaring the American Legion Riders post as a valuable asset to the community.

Remember: Motorcyclists can be a very dedicated group of people. When they are also American Legion Family members, you create a win/win situation for your post and community!

If you would like to join us, we meet the first Tuesday of every month at 6 PM at the Veterans Hall 100 East St. Auburn CA. 95603
You must own and be legally licensed to ride a motorcycle that is at least 500cc in size.

40 & 8

The Society of forty men and eight horses

An independent fraternal organization of U. S. veterans, more commonly known as the 40 & 8.

The Forty & Eight was formed in 1920 by American Legionnaires as an honor society and from its earliest days it has been committed to charitable aims. Membership is by invitation for members of the American Legion who have shown exemplary service. All Forty & Eight members are thus veterans of congressionally recognized wartime periods via their Legion membership.

The Forty & Eight’s titles and symbols reflect its First World War origins. American servicemen in France were transported to the battle front on narrow gauge French railroads (Chemin de Fer) inside boxcars (Voitures) that were half the size of American boxcars. Each French boxcar was stenciled with a “40/8”, denoting its capacity to hold either forty men or eight horses. This ignominious and uncomfortable mode of transportation was familiar to all who traveled from the coast to the trenches; a common small misery among American soldiers who thereafter found “40/8” a lighthearted symbol of the deeper service, sacrifice and unspoken horrors of war that truly bind those who have borne the battle.

SONS OF THE LEGION

sal_display_big_lowres.jpg

Are you a a son of a veteran? Would you like to join The American Legion? Check your local American Legion Post where you can find out your eligibility status and apply for membership in the world's largest veteran's organization. Complete the application and proudly become a SON OF THE LEGION.

Q: I am related to someone who served on active duty during one of the membership eligibilty dates. Can I join the Sons of The American Legion?

A: If your relative who served on active duty during one of the membership eligibility dates and is a member of The American Legion, you may join the Sons of The American Legion.

However, if the qualifying veteran is deceased you may join the appropriate organization, even if the qualifying veteran was not a member of The American Legion when living.

Preamble to the S.A.L. National Constitution

Proud possessors of a priceless heritage, we male descendants of veterans of the Great Wars, associate ourselves together as "Sons of The American Legion" for the following purposes:  To uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States of America; to maintain law and order; to foster and perpetuate a true spirit of Americanism; to preserve the memories of our former members and the associations of our members and our forefathers in the Great Wars; to inculcate a sense of individual obligation to the community, state and nation; to combat the autocracy of both the classes and masses; to make right the master of might; to promote peace and good will on earth; to safeguard and transmit to posterity the principles of justice, freedom and democracy; to consecrate and sanctify our friendship by our devotion to mutual helpfulness; to adopt in letter and spirit all of the great principles for which The American Legion stands; and to assist in carrying on for God and Country.

Auburn Squadron 84

Auburn Squadron has 30 members, unfortunately we are a paperwork Squadron. I (Court) would very much like to get this Squadron active and I'm looking for someone to assist in making this happen. Our parents served our country and in most cases are still serving in the American Legion. The American Legion was founded by our forefathers to help other Veterans. The Sons of the American Legion was founded to help our parents preform this task. Like in my case I'm a member of both, having also served 22 years in the service. But my father is unable to serve any longer and now the baton has been passed on and it's my turn to help carry on the Legion Programs.

If you are interested in being an active member contact me.  Post 84 could really use our help! We do jobs like assisting with dinners, helping out at the bar, working on commissions (Baseball), marching in the parades, and helping our elder Legion members get to and from their meetings.

Starting January 2008 the dues have gone up! We will need to raise our dues to $12.00 a year, we've been paying $7.00 for many years and forwarding $6.50 to State and National. That was only leaving $.50 per member to maintain our Squadron. Hopefully this will not cause you to drop, remember that we're carrying on the legacy of our parents. Remember that the cost of just sending you your membership card takes up the rest of your dues payment of $7.00 ($.41).

SCHOLARSHIPS

NOTE: Each Post has its own list of Scholarships and other Programs. Encourage your legionnaires to place a high priority for the further education of our children. List the scholarships your Post sponsors.

American Legion Boys State is among the most respected and selective educational programs of government instruction for high school students. It is a participatory program where each participant becomes a part of the operation of his local, county and state government.

Boys State has been a program of The American Legion since 1935 when it organized to counter the Fascist inspired Young Pioneer Camps.

American Legion Boys State is currently conducted in 49 Departments of The American Legion. Hawaii does not conduct a program. As separate corporations, Boys States vary in content and method of procedure, but each and every Boys State adheres to the basic concept of the program - that of teaching government from the township to the state level.

STANLEY JOHNSON NURSING / HEALTH SCIENCE SCHOLARSHIP

The Stanley Johnson Nursing / Health Science Scholarship is awarded to the student who continues his/her higher education pursuing a degree in nursing/medical or health science fields.

Stanley Johnson came to the United States from England at the age of 15. He worked for many years at the U.S. Challenge Company in Batavia and later at Burgess-Norton in Geneva. Stanley Johnson so loved this country that he joined the United States Armed Forces in World War I.

After being honorably discharged Stanley married Hattie Swan and together they worked tirelessly for the American Legion and the American Legion Auxiliary. Stanley served 52 years as Treasurer for Batavia Post 504.

This scholarship was established by the Johnson's in honor of his niece, Jean Johnson, who was a British nurse. Because of the importance of encouraging our youth to become future doctors, nurses or other health related professionals Batavia Post 504 has continued awarding this scholarship to date.

Folding the Flag
foldingu.s.flag.gif

1. Bring the striped half up over the blue field.

2. Then fold it in half again.

3. Bring the lower striped corner to the upper edge forming a triangle.

4. Then fold the upper point in to form another triangle. Continue until the entire length of the flag is folded.

5. When you get near the end - nothing but the blue field showing - tuck the last bit into the other folds to secure it.

WHY THE AMERICAN FLAG IS FOLDED 13 TIMES.

Have you ever noticed on TV or at military funerals that the honor guard pays meticulous attention to correctly folding the American flag 13 times? Each fold of the U.S. flag has an important meaning. We have verified its accuracy at the U.S. Air Force Academy Web site [go to main page, then click on "Information", then on "Flags"].
1. The first fold of our flag is a symbol of life.

2. The second fold is a symbol of our belief in eternal life.

3. The third fold is made in honor and remembrance of the veterans departing our ranks who gave a portion of their lives for the defense of our country to attain peace throughout the world.

4. The fourth fold represents our weaker nature, for as American citizens trusting in God, it is to Him we turn in times of peace as well as in time of war for His divine guidance.

5. The fifth fold is a tribute to our country, for in the words of Stephen Decatur, "Our Country, in dealing with other countries, may she always be right; but it is still our country, right or wrong."

6. The sixth fold is for where our hearts lie. It is with our heart that we pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with Liberty and Justice for all.

7. The seventh fold is a tribute to our Armed Forces, for it is through the Armed Forces that we protect our country and our flag against all her enemies, whether they are found within or without the boundaries of our republic.

8. The eighth fold is a tribute to the one who entered into the valley of the shadow of death, that we might see the light of day, and to honor mother, for whom it flies on Mother's Day.

9. The ninth fold is a tribute to womanhood; for it has been through their faith, their love, loyalty and devotion that the character of the men and women who have made this country great has been molded.

10. The tenth fold is a tribute to the father, for he, too, has given his sons and daughters for the defense of our country since they were first born.

11. The eleventh fold, in the eyes of a Hebrew citizen represents the lower portion of the seal of King David and King Solomon, and glorifies in their eyes, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

12. The twelfth fold, in the eyes of a Christian citizen, represents an emblem of eternity and glorifies, in their eyes, God the Father, the Son, and Holy Spirit.

13. When the flag is completely folded, the stars are uppermost reminding us of our nation's motto, "In God We Trust". After the flag is completely folded and tucked in, it takes on the appearance of a cocked hat, ever reminding us of the soldiers who served under General George Washington, and the sailors and marines who served under Captain John Paul Jones. Those who were followed by their comrades and shipmates in the Armed Forces of the United States, preserving for us the rights, privileges, and freedoms we enjoy today.

POST HISTORY

On September 12, 1919, a group of World War One Veterans decided to start up a local post of the new veteran's organization that was recently charterd by the U.S. Congress - The American Legion.

Initially, they met at a local Auburn Establishment that was located in what is now called Old Town.

Since our charter in 1919, our American Legion Post has been welcoming VETERANS from all branches of our Armed Forces. Today, we continue to welcome all military personnel serving our country.

Join us and keep the history alive.

WHY JOIN THE AMERICAN LEGION?

Do You Remember?
Do you remember when your unit was under fire? You were scared. You didn't know whether you would ever get home again, see your family, your loved ones. And the only thing that you could count on in that instant was your buddy. And you knew he was counting on you too.
Perhaps you were one of the lucky ones who never saw combat. Do you remember the tediousness of garrison life? Do you remember the interminable hurry up and wait? Do you remember the inane make-work projects you were ordered to do? But your buddy was always there along side you, making the wise-crack, helping you make it though each day, maybe even covering for you on occasion.

Your buddy still needs you!!!

Maybe your buddy is in one of the VA hospitals; his war wounds and/or time have taken its toll on his body. Maybe he or she is a young veteran, just discharged from service in the Gulf War or Bosnia and is having difficulty finding a civilian job. Maybe your buddy is just an ordinary guy or gal like yourself, wanting to share stories and comradeship with someone who was in a similar situation.

Your buddy still needs you!!!

The American Legion is the place for you to help your buddy and for your buddy to help you. Founded in 1918, it is the largest veteran's organization in the United States with over 3 million members.

Your buddy still needs you!!!

We are veterans just like you. We care about America,our fellow veterans. our families and our children. As a member of our Post  we continue to serve our God, our Country and our Community. Our Post needs you now.

Our Legionnaires participate in many community activities such as parades, memorials, dedications, etc.

We have a funeral honor guard detail ready, willing and able at the family's request. Our funeral detail is available to all veterans. When requested, we are also available to help other veteran organizations with their memorials.

We sponsor local students to participate in Boy State, sponsor scholarships to better educate our children.

Our Post  needs you now.  AMERICA NEEDS YOU - JOIN NOW

The American Legion was chartered by Congress in 1919 as a patriotic, mutual-help, war-time veterans organization. A community-service organization which now numbers nearly 3 million members -- men and women -- in nearly 15,000 American Legion Posts worldwide. These Posts are organized into 55 Departments -- one each for the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, France, Mexico, and the Philippines.

The American Legion's national headquarters is in Indianapolis, Indiana, with additional offices in Washington, DC.
