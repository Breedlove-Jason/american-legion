                  Post 84 meets on the the 2nd Wednesday of each month, unless
                  otherwise posted. It is held at the Auburn Veterans Memorial
                  Building, 100 East St., Auburn, CA. We start the night off with
                  a social hour beginning 5 PM, which is generally followed by a
                  $5 dinner at around 6 PM. Following dinner we have our business
                  meeting with a monthly speaker. Please call the Post at
                  530-889-8574 for more information.
